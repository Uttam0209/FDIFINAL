			<h4>Innovation for Defence Excellence(iDEX)</h4>
			<p>Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX), the ﬁrst initiative of its kind in the country, was launched by Hon’ble PM in April 2018. It is a scheme formulated in collaboration with Atal Innovation Mission (AIM). iDEX is aimed at creation of an ecosystem to foster innovation and technology development in Defence and Aerospace and solve related problems, by engaging Industries, including MSMEs, Start-ups, Individual Innovators, R&D institutes and Academia and provide them grants/funding and other support to carry out R&D. It is expected that India can take advantage of its vibrant start-up ecosystem to develop technologies related to defence and aerospace. iDEX has so far run 3 rounds of Defence India Start-up Challenges, and two rounds of Open Challenge.</p>
			<p>Information pertaining to the guidelines, frameworks, procedures and challenges can be accessed at idex.gov.in.</p>
