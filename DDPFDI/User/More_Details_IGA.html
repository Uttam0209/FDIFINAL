			<h4>Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA)</h4>
			<p>Inter-Governmental Agreements (IGAs) are inter government agreements for procurements or transfer of technology from foreign countries. Details are covered at Para 104 to 105 of Chapter II of DPP 2016.</p>
			<p>In this case, it refers to an agreement between India and Russia on “Mutual Cooperation in Joint Manufacturing of Spares, Components, Aggregates and other material related to Russian/Soviet Origin Arms and Defence Equipment”. This was signed during the India-Russia Summit in 2019.  The objective of the IGA is to enhance the aftersales support and operational availability of Russian origin equipment currently in service in Indian Armed Forces by organizing production of spares and components in the territory of India by Indian Industry by way of creation of Joint Ventures/Partnership with Russian Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) under the framework of the “Make in India” initiative.</p>
			<p>About 1000 types of spares are expected to be manufactured in India under this agreement for which 30 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) have already been signed so far between Indian companies and Russian Original Equipment Manufacturers for manufacturing of these spares in India. The Indian Navy, Indian Air Force and the Ordnance Factory Board have issued RFPs for about 400 spares under the IGA.</p>
