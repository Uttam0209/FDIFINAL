            Pursuant to ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ announcement, the Department of Defence Production/Ministry of Defence/Government of India has developed this portal named, <b><a href="https://srijandefence.gov.in/ProductList">srijandefence.gov.in</a></b>, as “Opportunities for Make in India in Defence”.  The main objective of the portal is to partner the private sector in indigenization efforts of Defence Public Sector Undertakings(DPSUs), OFB and the Armed Forces. The portal will be a non-transactional online market place platform.      
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            DPSUs/OFB/SHQs will display their items on this portal, which they have imported or going to import, each item having sizeable import value. They will also display those items which have been planned/targeted in the coming years, for indigenization.    
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            The Indian industry will be able to show their interest in those items for which they can design, develop and manufacture as per their capability or through joint venture with OEMs. The concerned DPSUs/OFB/SHQs, based on their requirement of the items and their respective guidelines & procedures, will interact with the interested Indian industry for indigenization. The interested Indian industry can also interact with concerned DPSUs/OFB/SHQs for their queries related to indigenization through the contact details given under each item.
