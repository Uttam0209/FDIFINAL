                <h4>Indigenization</h4>
                <p>OFB/DPSUs/SHQs adopt various processes of indigenization for development of defence equipment or their sub-systems/sub-assembly/assemblies/components/ materials, primarily for import substitution. These include In-house and Industry Process (Make-II and Other than Make-II).</p>
                <h5>1. In-house Process</h5>
                <p>OFB/DPSUs/SHQs may use their In-house capability to indigenize their items.</p>
                <h5>2. Industry Process</h5>
                <h6>a. Make-II</h6>
                <p>OFB/DPSUs’ Make-II procedure is based on the similar Make-II procedure promulgated by Ministry of Defence under DPP-2016. Under this procedure, no Government funding is envisaged for prototype development purposes but there is an assurance of orders on successful development and trials of the prototype.</p>
                <p>‘Make-II’ development process starts with approval of project by OFB/DPSUs, subsequent to which EoI is issued online. Based on the EoI responses, Development Order is issued to selected Development Agency(ies). On successful development of prototype, procurement order is given to the lowest bidding Development Agency (DA).</p>
                <p>The list of items taken up for indigenous development under Make-II is uploaded on respective websites of OFB/DPSUs and is updated periodically. The same is also available at srijandefence.gov.in. The detailed framework for implementation of ‘Make-II’ Procedure at OFB & DPSUs can be downloaded here.</p>
                <h6>b. Other than Make-II</h6>
                <p>DPSUs/OFB/SHQs may adopt their other extant processes of indigenization.  The other extant processes of indigenization have been clubbed as “Other than Make-II”.</p>
